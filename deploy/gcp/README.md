# Automated GCP release pipeline

This directory holds the on-VM half of the automated release path. It performs the
cutover documented in [deploy/README.md](../README.md); that document remains the
authority on *why* each step exists and is the procedure to follow by hand when the
pipeline is unavailable.

Two GitHub workflows drive it:

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`publish-image.yml`](../../.github/workflows/publish-image.yml) | push to `main`, push `v*` tags, manual (dry run by default) | On a push to `main` (or a manual run on `main` with `dry_run` off), its amd64 job builds the Rust image for `linux/amd64` and pushes `rust-git-<full sha>` to Artifact Registry, then attests provenance. That job depends on nothing else in the workflow. A native arm64 build runs alongside, and once both finish, the GHCR job publishes a multi-arch image made from the same amd64 manifest. Publishing runs are never cancelled. |
| [`deploy-gcp.yml`](../../.github/workflows/deploy-gcp.yml) | manual only | Production only from `main`. Requires a successful `rust.yml` push or scheduled run (with its `Rust port` job) for the revision, resolves `rust-git-<sha>` to a digest and runs `campfire-release.sh` on the app VM through an IAP SSH tunnel. |

Production runs the Rust port. The release script only moves one Rust image (label
`net.smartdata.campfire.runtime=rust`) to another; the Rails images and their
`git-<sha>` tags are history.

## The ordering rule

**Everything that could discover a migration problem happens before the live
application is touched.** While writes are frozen, the candidate image migrates a
*copy* of the frozen database (`campfire db-migrate`) inside a throwaway container with
`--network none`, `campfire db-check` must accept the result, and
`verify-additive-sqlite-migration` must exit `0`. Only then does the cutover run, and
its first step is the same `campfire db-migrate` on the stopped live database, which
must apply exactly what the rehearsal applied before the new container starts. The Rust
server never migrates on boot; it refuses a database whose migration versions differ
from its own.

Once the new image is serving traffic it may have accepted writes, so the checks that
run after the cutover are **read-only**. They can fail the release loudly, but nothing
they find justifies restoring a database over writes that users may already have made.

That rule is the reason the recovery phase behaves the way it does:

- If the live database is **byte-for-byte what it was at the freeze**, nothing was
  accepted. The previous image is restored automatically and nothing is lost.
- If **every row still matches the database the cutover's migration produced**, then
  nothing but the migration and the new image's boot bookkeeping touched it. That
  bookkeeping is its job queue and SQLite's AUTOINCREMENT counters, which change the
  bytes even when the image never serves. The check is the previous image's
  `verify-additive-sqlite-migration` on copies, requiring no added table or column.
  The frozen copy kept at the freeze is put back and the previous image is restored
  (`migration-reverted`), and nothing is lost. This is the one case where recovery
  writes the database, and it is needed: the previous image refuses a migrated
  database. With no migration, the database is left as it is (`image-rolled-back`).
- The one tolerated difference is **the job queue's rows** (`background_jobs`): a
  booting candidate claims due jobs, runs or fails them and enqueues its periodic
  work. When that table's row data is the only failed check, in both directions
  (so no table, column, index or trigger was added either), the frozen copy is put
  back and those queue changes are discarded: jobs the candidate enqueued are gone,
  and jobs it ran or failed are due again under the previous image. That is the
  queue's at-least-once contract, as after a crash. `rollback-result.json` records
  `job_queue_changes_discarded: true`. A job that wrote any other table makes that
  table differ, and the rollback refuses as below.
- Putting the frozen copy back first stages it next to the live database,
  fingerprints and syncs it. Only then are the live log and database replaced, so
  a full disk or a failed copy leaves the live database exactly as it was.
- If the live database has **changed in any other way** (a message, anything), the
  recovery phase **refuses to restore the database** and exits with an
  operator-action message and exit code `30`. Restoring the frozen copy there would
  silently discard whatever came after it. It runs the previous image's
  `campfire db-check` on a copy: if that accepts the database the previous image is
  restored (`refused-database-changed`); if not, the candidate is started again so
  chat stays up (`refused-database-incompatible`).

The comparison uses `frozen_live_database_sha256` in `freeze-result.json`: a digest of
the live `db/production.sqlite3` *and its write-ahead log* as they sat in the volume
with the application stopped. It is deliberately not the digest of `before.sqlite3`,
which is a logically equivalent but physically different file produced by SQLite's
backup API.

## Authentication

Neither VM has a runtime GCP service account, and no long-lived key is ever copied
onto one. GitHub Actions authenticates through Workload Identity Federation:

- `github-image-publisher@…` may write to the `campfire` Artifact Registry repository.
  Any job in this repository may impersonate it.
- `github-deployer@…` may read the repository, log in over OS Login with sudo, open an
  IAP tunnel and create boot-disk snapshots. Only jobs running in the `production` or
  `validation` GitHub environment may impersonate it, so a branch cannot deploy without
  going through an environment and its protection rules.
- `campfire-image-puller@…` holds `artifactregistry.reader` and nothing else.
  `github-deployer` holds `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` on it.

Where this organization has GitHub's ID-qualified OIDC subjects enabled, the
per-environment `principal://…/subject/…` bindings on `github-deployer` must spell the
subject the way GitHub now mints it —
`repo:Smart-Data-Ohio@262436228/smartfire@1370426325:environment:<name>` — and not
the older `repo:Smart-Data-Ohio/once-campfire:environment:<name>`. Attribute-based
`principalSet` bindings (`repository`, `repository_owner`) are unaffected. A subject
that does not match presents as `iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken` denied on the
deployer service account, which the deploy workflow now surfaces in its own words
rather than as a missing image.

**The VM never receives the deployer's own credential.** The runner mints a token for
the read-only puller with
`gcloud auth print-access-token --impersonate-service-account="$GCP_IMAGE_PULLER_SA"`
and pipes only that into the SSH session's standard input. It is never written to a
file, an environment variable or `argv`. The `finish` (or `logout`) phase runs
`docker logout` and asserts that `/root/.docker/config.json` no longer contains any
`auths` entry. So the worst a compromised app VM can do with what it was handed is
read images it can already run.

## Optional Google configuration

The deploy workflow's `configure_google` input defaults to `false`. When enabled,
it validates the protected environment configuration before preflight (including
in a dry run), then calls `configure-google.py` after successful cutover and before
`finish` removes the read-only registry credential. This second ONCE update keeps
the same pinned image and storage and merges the complete existing environment.
It verifies all old runtime values and non-environment settings, with only the
six declared Google/URL values allowed to change. Automatic image updates remain
disabled. See [Google setup](../../docs/google-workspace-setup.md) for the secret
and variable names; no domain or company defaults are built into the scripts.

The configuration step takes the same release lock, saves private settings and
diagnostics in a root-only `/var/backups/smartfire-google-config-<timestamp>/`
directory, and emits only an allowlisted verification result. It does not modify
the database directly. If it fails after cutover, the workflow reports failure,
does not restore the database or automatically downgrade the healthy image, and
leaves the feed timer paused for an operator; the always-run cleanup still removes
registry credentials. Inspect the protected diagnostics before retrying.

Run its local checks with
`python3 -m unittest discover -s deploy/gcp -p 'test_google_configuration.py'`.

## Repository tags are immutable

Artifact Registry rejects moving an existing tag. `publish-image.yml` therefore
looks the tag up first: if `rust-git-<sha>` already exists it skips the build and resolves
the published digest, so re-running the workflow for an already-released revision is a
no-op rather than a failure. A lookup that fails for any reason *other* than "not
found" — auth, network, permissions — fails the run instead of rebuilding blindly into
a tag collision.

## `campfire-release.sh`

`campfire-release.sh` runs as root on the app VM and takes one phase per invocation.
Splitting it into phases lets the runner take the boot-disk snapshot at exactly the
moment writes are frozen. Every invocation takes `flock` on
`/var/lock/campfire-release.lock`, so two releases can never interleave on one host.

| Phase | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `prepare-host` | Makes sure the host itself can survive the release: an idempotent `/swapfile` of `SWAP_SIZE_MB` (default 1024), built beside the live file and moved into place whole, with a `findmnt`-verified `/etc/fstab` entry and `vm.swappiness=10` persisted in `/etc/sysctl.d/90-campfire.conf`. **Never resizes an existing swap file and only ever runs `mkswap` on a file it built itself**; under `HOST_PREP_STRICT=false` that drift is a warning recorded as `skipped_reason` rather than a failure. Needs no other phase's state, touches neither the application nor the registry, and honours `DRY_RUN=true`. |
| `preflight` | Discovers the ONCE app, container, storage volume and current digest; **records the feed timer state once** (a retry never overwrites it); checks free disk against the real volume and image sizes; refuses to run on top of an in-flight ONCE backup or inside the nightly backup window; authenticates to the registry from stdin; pulls the exact digest and asserts it is `linux/amd64`. A dry run stops here. |
| `freeze` | **Refuses a release directory that already has `freeze-result.json` unless `RESUME=1`.** Pauses the feed timer and waits for the current feed run to finish; snapshots the database through the SQLite backup API; stops the app and **asserts no application container is still running**; fingerprints the live database; hashes every uploaded file; tags `campfire-rollback:before-<label>`; archives the ONCE application and the host feed state; keeps a byte-for-byte copy of the stopped live database (`frozen-live/`); then **rehearses the migration** on another copy. Any failure here restores the feed timer through a trap and, when the app had already been stopped, starts the previous container again and waits for `/up` (the rehearsal only ever touches copies, so a refused release must not become an outage). |
| `cutover` | Requires a passed rehearsal for this exact image and frozen database, runs `campfire db-migrate` with the candidate on the stopped live database (`live-migration-result.json`; a failure, or a result that differs from the rehearsal, exits `10` before anything serves), then `once update <host> --image IMAGE@DIGEST --auto-update=false` (no `--env`, so ONCE keeps the whole existing environment map), waits for `/up` to return 200, then runs read-only checks: running digest, environment key names, volume identity, pre-existing uploaded file hashes, and required processes. Exits `10` if it never became healthy and `20` if it became healthy but a check failed. |
| `rollback` | Refuses outright when the cutover already reported healthy and `/up` still returns 200: an interruption after a successful cutover must not downgrade a working deployment, so it records `refused-application-healthy` and exits `30` with the outstanding bookkeeping. Otherwise it stops the app, asserts it is stopped, removes any leftover migration container, then compares the live database fingerprint to the freeze and to the post-migration fingerprint. **The only database write it ever makes is putting the frozen copy back when every row still matches what the migration produced, or differs only in the job queue's rows** (`migration-reverted`, or `image-rolled-back` with `database_restored: true`), which the previous image's verifier checks on copies. Otherwise it returns ONCE to the previous image and gets it serving again — trying a plain `once start` first when the container left on the host still carries the previous image, then **checking what actually came up** and falling through to `once update --image <previous registry reference>` unless the previous image is really what is running. The label is a hint, not proof: ONCE keeps no state on disk, so an `once update` that failed after rewriting it can make a local start boot the candidate instead. What differs is the verdict: an unchanged or reverted database means nothing was lost and the phase exits `0`; a database that accepted writes is **not** restored over, and the run is recorded as `refused-database-changed` (previous image accepts it and is serving) or `refused-database-incompatible` (it doesn't, so the candidate is serving), exiting `30` to page an operator. Leaves the feed timer paused either way. |
| `finish` | Restores the feed timer to its recorded state, drops registry credentials, writes `finish-result.json` and `writes-reopened-at`, then prunes old release directories. |
| `logout` | Drops registry credentials only. Used to end a dry run. |
| `timer-state` | Prints the recorded and current feed timer state as JSON. Read-only. |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `1` | A precondition or a phase failed. Nothing was cut over. |
| `10` | The cutover never reached a healthy `/up`. If it aborted before the live migration the database is untouched; if the migration ran but the candidate never served, the rollback reverts it to the frozen bytes. Either way the rollback completes cleanly. If the candidate accepted writes first, the run exits `30`. |
| `20` | The application became healthy but a read-only check failed. It may have accepted writes, so it is **left running** and the workflow does not attempt recovery. The job fails; an operator decides. |
| `30` | The rollback refused to change something. Either the database accepted writes after the freeze and was left as it was (the previous image is serving if it accepts the database, otherwise the candidate is), or the application is healthy on the new image and was left running untouched. **An operator must act** in both cases. |

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RELEASE_LABEL` | *(required)* | Names `/var/backups/campfire-<label>/` and the rollback tag. `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` only. |
| `IMAGE_REF` | *(required for `preflight`/`freeze`/`cutover`)* | Must be pinned as `IMAGE@sha256:<64 hex>`. |
| `RESUME` | `0` | `1` lets `freeze` reuse a release directory that already completed, deliberately pairing a new cutover with an older backup. |
| `EXPECTED_APP_HOST` | unset | When set, `preflight` refuses to continue if the VM serves a different host. |
| `EXPECTED_GIT_REVISION` | unset | Required. `preflight` refuses a candidate image whose `GIT_REVISION` differs, and refuses an empty value. `deploy-gcp.yml` passes the full SHA it deploys. |
| `ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_REVISION` | `0` | `1` skips that check for a hand-run release with no requested commit. Preflight records it, and `freeze` and `cutover` refuse an unverified preflight unless it is set again. |
| `REGISTRY_HOST` | `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev` | Registry to authenticate against. |
| `TIMER_UNIT` | `campfire-open-roles.timer` | Feed timer to pause and restore. |
| `SERVICE_UNIT` | `${TIMER_UNIT%.timer}.service` | The oneshot service the timer activates. `freeze` waits for it to go inactive before stopping the app. |
| `FEED_DRAIN_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Seconds to wait for a feed run already in flight. |
| `HEALTH_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Seconds to wait for `/up` to return 200. |
| `STATE_ROOT` | `/var/backups` | Parent of the release directories. Its filesystem is the one checked for capacity, and pruning happens inside it. |
| `OPEN_ROLES_PATHS` | the five feed paths | Space-separated host paths archived into `before-host.tar.gz`. The ONCE application archive does not include them. |
| `MIN_FREE_DISK_MB` | `3072` | Floor checked before the image is pulled. |
| `RELEASE_KEEP` | `3` | Release directories kept when pruning. |
| `ALLOW_BACKUP_WINDOW` | `0` | `1` overrides the nightly ONCE backup window guard. |
| `DRY_RUN` | `false` | Exactly `true` or `false`; anything else is an error. `true` makes `prepare-host` report what it would change and change nothing else. It still writes its result file. |
| `HOST_PREP_STRICT` | `true` | `false` downgrades a wrong-sized swap file and a disk-floor violation from a failure to a warning recorded as `skipped_reason`. `deploy-gcp.yml` passes `false`, `configure-gcp-host.yml` passes `true`. |
| `SWAP_PATH` | `/swapfile` | The one swap file `prepare-host` manages. No other swap device is ever touched. |
| `SWAP_SIZE_MB` | `1024` | Size of that swap file. A positive integer; an existing file of another size is refused, never resized. |
| `SWAPPINESS` | `10` | `vm.swappiness` persisted in `SYSCTL_FILE`. |
| `SYSCTL_FILE` | `/etc/sysctl.d/90-campfire.conf` | The sysctl drop-in `prepare-host` owns and rewrites. |
| `MIN_FREE_AFTER_SWAP_MB` | `5120` | Free space that must remain on the swap file's filesystem after it exists. |
| `LOCK_FILE` | `/var/lock/campfire-release.lock` | The per-host release lock. |
| `CAMPFIRE_RELEASE_SIMULATE_FAILURE` | `0` | Validation only. `1` aborts the cutover before `once update`, so the database is provably untouched and the rollback completes. `2` lets the app go healthy and then forces a read-only check to fail, which is the case where the rollback must refuse. The deploy workflow rejects either outside the `validation` environment. |

### Capacity

`preflight` checks the filesystem that actually holds `STATE_ROOT`, not
`/var/lib/docker`, and sizes the requirement from measurements rather than a guess:
`du -sm` of the storage volume × 2 (the pre-release ONCE archive and one more copy)
plus the database × 8 + 512 MB on the `STATE_ROOT` filesystem. Eight covers the seven
copies held at the peak (`before.sqlite3`, `frozen-live`, the rehearsal's working copy,
its backup-API snapshot, `rehearsal-before`, `rehearsal-after`, `after.sqlite3`) plus
one for `migrated-live` and the rollback comparison copies made later, and the image size + the database (the live migration's write-ahead log)
+ 512 MB on `/var/lib/docker`. When
both paths are on the same filesystem the two are summed and checked once.

### Host preparation

The app VM is an `e2-small`: 2 GB of RAM and, until this phase existed, no swap at
all. A release is the worst moment on that host — a migration, a rehearsal container
and two application containers briefly overlap — and with no swap the kernel's only
answer to a spike is the OOM killer. 1 GB of swap turns that into slowness, which a
release can survive; `vm.swappiness=10` keeps the kernel from using it for anything
less urgent, so the steady state stays in RAM and the disk stays quiet.

`prepare-host` is therefore part of the release path: `deploy-gcp.yml` runs it on
every run, dry or real, **before preflight** — preflight's capacity arithmetic has to
be the last word, and a swap file created after it would quietly eat a gigabyte of
the budget it had just approved. On a prepared host the phase is a no-op that reports
what is already there, and `swap_created` in `prepare-host-result.json` says whether
this run made the file. `swap_size_mb` reports the size of the file that is actually
on the host — `0` when there is none — and `swap_requested_mb` what was asked for;
the two differ exactly when the phase decided to leave the host alone, in which case
`skipped_reason` names the condition and `skipped_message` says it in words.

It is deliberately unwilling to do the interesting thing:

- A swap file already at **a different size** is never resized. Resizing means
  `swapoff` on a host that may be leaning on it, so the remedy is an operator's:
  `swapoff /swapfile`, remove the file, run the phase again. The message reports both
  sizes in exact bytes.
- A file at `SWAP_PATH` carrying a **signature that is not swap** — a filesystem
  image, an archive — is refused outright. `mkswap` over it would destroy data.
- A file at `SWAP_PATH` carrying **no signature at all** is refused for the same
  reason. Nothing distinguishes a swap file nobody formatted from a file somebody
  left there, and an absent signature is not evidence of an empty file, so `mkswap`
  only ever runs on a file this phase built itself. A pre-existing swap file that is
  merely inactive is simply `swapon`'d.
- It refuses to create a swap file that would leave the root filesystem under 5 GB
  free, and it never touches a swap device other than `SWAP_PATH`.

`HOST_PREP_STRICT` decides what all of that *means*. The on-demand workflow runs
strict (`true`): fixing the host is the point of the run, so drift fails it. A release
runs non-strict (`false`): the condition is logged as a warning, the swap file and
`/etc/fstab` are left untouched — `vm.swappiness` is still applied, since it is
independent of the swap file — and the reason is recorded in the result file as
`skipped_reason` and surfaced in the job summary. A release must never be blocked by
a swap file somebody else sized. The recorded reasons are `wrong-size`,
`non-swap-signature`, `unsigned-file`, `not-a-regular-file`,
`preexisting-file-refused`, `insufficient-free-space` and `fstab-preexisting-errors`,
each with the operator-facing sentence in `skipped_message`.

Drift is not the same as a fault. A missing tool, a `mkswap` that fails on a file
this run just built, or an `/etc/fstab` that only this phase's own line broke are
bugs in the phase or in the host's basics, and they fail in either mode. As a second
line of defence the release workflow marks the step `continue-on-error`, so even
those cannot stop a release; the step's outcome is reported in the job summary and
the release record instead. The on-demand workflow deliberately does not, because
there a failure is the answer the run exists to give.

Two failure modes get specific care, because both are the kind that only show up
later:

- **Creation is never partial.** The file is built at `/swapfile.new`, filled,
  `mkswap`'d and only then moved into place, with an `EXIT` trap that removes the
  partial file and a sweep that removes a stale one at the start of the next run. A
  step timeout, a cancelled job or a dropped IAP tunnel therefore leaves nothing that
  the next release would refuse as wrong-sized.
- **`/etc/fstab` is never appended to blindly.** The phase verifies the existing
  file with `findmnt --verify` *before anything else happens*: an `/etc/fstab` that
  was already broken is the host's problem, but adding a swap entry to it — or
  activating swap this phase could then not record — would make it ours, so it stops
  there (`fstab-preexisting-errors`). Otherwise it builds the candidate beside the
  original, terminates it with a newline if the original lacked one (a last line
  without one would fuse with the swap entry and send the next reboot into emergency
  mode), verifies the candidate, keeps the previous copy as `/etc/fstab.campfire.bak`,
  and only then moves it into place with the original's mode and owner. A dry run
  builds and verifies that candidate too, then throws it away, so a green dry run
  means the real append verifies.

Whether `fallocate` can be used is settled by asking it for one megabyte first, not
by letting a real allocation fail halfway, so the code that builds the file runs
under `errexit` and a failing `mkswap` is reported as a failing `mkswap`. If `swapon`
then refuses a file this run just created with `fallocate` — the "swapfile has holes"
case on some filesystems — the phase rebuilds that same file with `dd` and retries
once. A file it did not create is never removed or rewritten. It also warns, without
failing, when `/etc/sysctl.conf` sets `vm.swappiness`, because systemd applies that
file after everything in `/etc/sysctl.d` and it would win at every boot.

**Configure GCP host** (`.github/workflows/configure-gcp-host.yml`) applies the same
phase on demand: `workflow_dispatch`, one `dry_run` input, the `production`
environment, and the same concurrency group `deploy-gcp.yml` uses for production, so
a host change and a production release can never overlap on that VM. It writes into a
fixed `/var/backups/campfire-host-prep/`, overwritten each run, so on-demand runs do
not accumulate directories. It copies the release script, runs `prepare-host`,
removes only its own copy from the deployer's home directory — the installed
`/opt/campfire-deploy/campfire-release.sh` stays, exactly as a release leaves it —
and writes the result to the job summary. It touches nothing else: not the app, the
registry, the feed timer or a snapshot.

### Retention

Release directories hold a full copy of the database and the application archive, so
they are not free. `finish` keeps the newest `RELEASE_KEEP` (default 3) directories
matching `campfire-*` under `STATE_ROOT` and deletes the rest — **only after a
successful release**, so a failed one never deletes a checkpoint an operator still
needs. Nothing else prunes them; a long run of failures will accumulate directories
until someone intervenes, which is the intended bias.

### Release record directory

Each release leaves `/var/backups/campfire-<label>/`, matching the shape of earlier
manual releases:

```text
before.sqlite3              database snapshot taken with the SQLite backup API
after.sqlite3               the same database after the rehearsal migration

                            downgrading a deployment that is still working
rollback-result.json        written only when the recovery phase ran
finish-result.json          feed timer state, registry logout proof, health
writes-reopened-at          the moment chat reopened
```

Treat `before.sqlite3`, `after.sqlite3`, `frozen-live/`, `migrated-live/` and both archives as secret: they contain user
data and application keys. The directory is `0700` and its files are `0600`. Nothing
this script creates is left inside the live storage volume; a trap clears any stray
copies on every path.

### Why environment *names* and not values

The app container's `once` Docker label is a JSON blob containing `secret_key_base`,
the VAPID private key and the LiveKit secrets, and `Config.Env` carries the same
values. The script only ever extracts `.name`, `.host`, `.image`, `.autoUpdate`,
`.disableTLS`, `.backup`, `.resources` and `env | keys`, plus the single `GIT_REVISION`
entry from an image's environment for the release record. Comparing the key *names*
before and after the update is what proves ONCE preserved the configured environment;
it never needs the values to do that.

### Migration verification without a sqlite3 CLI

The app VM has no `sqlite3` binary. The frozen database is snapshotted by running
`script/admin/prepare-backup` inside the container (SQLite's backup API). The rehearsal
then runs entirely inside a throwaway container built from the candidate image, on a
copy of `frozen-live/`:

```text
docker run --rm --network none --memory 768m -v <scratch>:/rails/storage -e SECRET_KEY_BASE_DUMMY=1 <image>
  script/admin/prepare-backup; cp backups/production.sqlite3 rehearsal-before.sqlite3
  campfire db-migrate db/production.sqlite3         # one transaction, prints MIGRATED: lines
  campfire db-check db/production.sqlite3           # the server's strict boot schema check
  script/admin/prepare-backup; cp backups/production.sqlite3 rehearsal-after.sqlite3

```

The rehearsal doesn't start the server on the copy: background jobs must never run
against a copy of production. `db-check` is the same schema check boot performs.

`--network none` keeps it isolated, `SECRET_KEY_BASE_DUMMY=1` means no production key
is needed, and the scratch directory is a copy, so the live volume is never mounted.
Only a pass/fail line and the preserved/additive counts reach the job log; the full
verifier output stays in `migration-verification.txt` on the host.

## Snapshot scope

The workflow snapshots the instance's **boot disk only**. On the current VMs the ONCE
storage volume lives under `/var/lib/docker` on that same disk, so the snapshot covers
it. If a data disk is ever attached, the workflow warns that it is not included and the
snapshot stops being a complete checkpoint.

## Running a release

1. Merge to `main`. `publish-image.yml` publishes `rust-git-<sha>` for every push;
   deploy a sha that has that tag.
2. There is no staging host: the `validation` environment currently falls back to the
   production VM, so don't use it. Rehearse locally instead: `rust/ops/tests` and, for
   a release that ships migrations, the migration from the deployed schema.
3. Run **Deploy to GCP** against `production` with `dry_run=true`, then
   `dry_run=false`, dispatched on `main`. A production deployment requires the revision
   to be an ancestor of `origin/main`, a successful `rust.yml` push or scheduled run for
   that exact sha with a successful `Rust port` job, and a candidate image whose
   `GIT_REVISION` is that sha, and waits for an environment reviewer.
4. Copy the paste-ready release record from the job summary into `docs/releases/`.

The default release label includes the workflow run id, so a retry always gets a fresh
directory and a fresh backup. Reusing an earlier label requires passing both
`release_label` and `resume=true`, which says in as many words that you intend to pair
this cutover with that older backup.

### How long writes are frozen

The freeze window is not just the database snapshot: it spans the ONCE and host
archives, the migration rehearsal, the boot-disk snapshot wait, and the cutover
itself. Measured end to end on the validation VM, with a ~400 KB database and no
uploaded files:

| Step | Wall time |
| --- | --- |
| `freeze` (snapshot, stop, hashes, archives, rehearsal) | ~25 s, of which the rehearsal is ~9 s |
| Boot-disk snapshot to `READY` | ~47 s |
| `cutover` (`once update`, health wait, checks) | ~18 s |
| `finish` | < 1 s |

So roughly **90 seconds** of frozen writes on a small database. The rehearsal and
the archives both scale with database size, and the snapshot wait scales with how
much of the boot disk has changed since the previous snapshot. Budget more for a
production-sized database, and use `skip_snapshot` only when a recent snapshot
already exists.

### When it does not complete

The recovery step runs on failure, cancellation and timeout alike, with one
deliberate exception: exit `20` — healthy, but a read-only check failed — leaves
the running application alone, because recovery begins by stopping it and a
reporting failure should not become an outage.

Recovery never writes to the database, and never downgrades an application that is
still healthy on the new image. Otherwise it restores the previous image and gets it
serving; the job summary then says plainly whether the database was left as it was
and an operator has to decide. The frozen checkpoint, the boot-disk snapshot and
the `campfire-rollback:before-<label>` image all stay on the host.

## ONCE 0.3.2 behaviour worth knowing

- `once update <host> --image …` **starts a stopped application**, so the freeze/cutover
  sequence does not need a separate `once start`. The script still checks and starts it
  if ONCE ever changes that.
- `once update --image` fails immediately with "Failed to download the application
  image" when Docker is not authenticated to the private registry. That is an auth
  error, not a bad reference.
- **`once update --image` always resolves the reference through a registry**, so it
  cannot use a local-only tag: passing `campfire-rollback:before-<label>` fails with
  the same "Failed to download the application image" message even though the image is
  present in the local Docker cache. The rollback therefore uses the previous image's
  own registry reference, and tries a plain `once start` first when the container left
  on the host still carries it. `campfire-rollback:before-<label>` is retained as an
  operator artifact — the exact bits survive locally even if the registry is
  unavailable — not as something ONCE can be pointed at directly.
- **ONCE keeps no state on disk.** Its configuration *is* the `once` label on the
  application container; there is no `/var/lib/once` or equivalent. That is why the
  rollback cannot simply trust the label it finds: an `once update` that failed after
  rewriting it leaves a host whose only container claims the previous image while ONCE
  itself points at the candidate, so a local `once start` would boot the broken image.
  The script starts it and then verifies what actually came up.
- `once backup` succeeds while the application is stopped, but the in-container
  pre-backup hook cannot run, so the archive contains the raw volume rather than a
  `data/backups/production.sqlite3` snapshot. With the app cleanly stopped the raw copy
  is coherent; the separate backup-API snapshot is taken just before the stop so the
  rehearsal has a known-good `before`.
- ONCE gives the replacement container a new random name suffix on every update, so the
  container must be rediscovered after the cutover. The script selects it by matching
  the ONCE label's `.image` against the exact reference it deployed rather than taking
  whichever container is listed first. The Docker volume name is stable.
- The volume is mounted at both `/storage` and `/rails/storage`.
- The image has no `ps`; use `docker top <container> -eo pid,args` from the host.
- `once list` writes ANSI colour and OSC-8 hyperlink escapes around the host name, so
  discovery reads the container label instead of parsing that output.
