# Smart Data Campfire - on-VM release driver for the ONCE single-VM deployment.
#
# This automates the cutover described in deploy/README.md. It runs as root on
# the app VM and is invoked one phase at a time by .github/workflows/deploy-gcp.yml
# so the runner can interleave a boot-disk snapshot between `freeze` and `cutover`.
#
# Both the running image and the candidate are the Rust port (image label
# net.smartdata.campfire.runtime=rust); anything else is refused at preflight.
# The app never migrates on boot: it refuses a database that has not run exactly
# its own migrations. Schema changes are an explicit step this script owns,
# `campfire db-migrate`, run with the candidate image.
#
# The ordering matters and is deliberate. Everything that could discover a
# migration problem happens while writes are frozen and BEFORE the live
# application is touched: the candidate image migrates a *copy* of the frozen
# database inside a throwaway, network-isolated container, and the result must
# pass the candidate's own schema check and the additive verifier. Only then
# does the cutover migrate the live database, with the app still stopped and
# the exact pre-migration bytes kept aside, so a cutover that never serves can
# put them back. Once the new image is serving traffic it may have accepted
# writes, so the checks that run after the cutover are read-only. They can fail
# the release loudly, but they never restore a database over accepted writes.
#
# Phases:
#   prepare-host  ensure the host itself is fit to run a release: a swap file of
#              the configured size and vm.swappiness. Needs no other phase's
#              state and touches neither the application nor the registry.
#   preflight  discover the app, require Rust on both sides, check capacity,
#              record the feed timer state, authenticate to the registry and
#              pull the exact digest.
#   freeze     pause the feed timer, snapshot the database through the SQLite
#              backup API, stop the app, keep a byte-exact copy of the stopped
#              database, archive everything, then rehearse the migration on a
#              copy with the candidate image.
#   cutover    `campfire db-migrate` on the live database with the candidate
#              image (app still stopped), image-only `once update`, health
#              wait, then read-only checks.
#   rollback   return to the previous image. The database is put back to its
#              frozen bytes ONLY when nothing but this release's migration
#              touched it; otherwise it is left alone.
#   finish     restore the feed timer, drop registry credentials, prune old
#              release directories.
#   logout     drop registry credentials only (used to end a dry run).
#
# SECURITY: the ONCE container label and its Config.Env contain secret_key_base,
# VAPID keys and LiveKit secrets. Nothing in this script prints a raw
# `docker inspect` of the app container or a raw ONCE settings blob. Only
# .image/.host/.name/.autoUpdate/.backup/.resources/.disableTLS and the *names*
# of environment variables are ever recorded or echoed.

set -euo pipefail

# --- inputs -----------------------------------------------------------------
# RELEASE_LABEL   required. Names /var/backups/campfire-<label>/ and the
#                 rollback image tag. [A-Za-z0-9._-] only.
# IMAGE_REF       required for preflight/freeze/cutover. Must be pinned as
#                 IMAGE@sha256:<64 hex>.
# RESUME          set to 1 to let `freeze` reuse an existing release directory
#                 that already completed. Off by default so a retry cannot
#                 silently pair a new cutover with a stale backup.
# EXPECTED_APP_HOST  when set, preflight refuses a VM serving a different host.
# REGISTRY_HOST   registry to authenticate against.
# TIMER_UNIT      feed timer to pause and restore.
# SERVICE_UNIT    the oneshot service the timer activates; derived from
#                 TIMER_UNIT unless set. Freeze waits for it to go inactive.
# FEED_DRAIN_TIMEOUT  seconds to wait for a feed run in flight to finish.
# HEALTH_TIMEOUT  seconds to wait for /up to return 200.
# STATE_ROOT      parent of the release directories. Its filesystem is the one
#                 checked for capacity, and pruning happens inside it.
# OPEN_ROLES_PATHS  space-separated host paths archived as the feed state.
# MIN_FREE_DISK_MB  floor checked before the image is pulled.
# RELEASE_KEEP    number of release directories to keep when pruning.
# ALLOW_BACKUP_WINDOW  1 to override the nightly ONCE backup window guard.
# DRY_RUN         true to have `prepare-host` report what it would change and
#                 change nothing else. It still writes its result file.
# HOST_PREP_STRICT  true (the default) makes host drift a hard failure in
#                 `prepare-host`. false downgrades a wrong-sized swap file and a
#                 disk-floor violation to a warning recorded as skipped_reason,
#                 so a release is never blocked by the state of the host.
# SWAP_PATH       swap file `prepare-host` manages. No other swap device is
#                 ever touched.
# SWAP_SIZE_MB    size of that swap file. An existing file of a different size
#                 is reported and refused, never resized.
# SWAPPINESS      vm.swappiness persisted in SYSCTL_FILE.
# SYSCTL_FILE     sysctl drop-in `prepare-host` owns.
# MIN_FREE_AFTER_SWAP_MB  free space that must remain after the swap file exists.
# CAMPFIRE_RELEASE_SIMULATE_FAILURE  validation only. `1` aborts the cutover
#                 before the live migration and `once update`, so the database
#                 is provably untouched and the rollback can complete. `2` lets the app go healthy and
#                 then forces a read-only check to fail, which is the case where
#                 the rollback must refuse to touch the database.

# touches any swap device other than SWAP_PATH. It needs no state from an
# earlier phase, so it can be run on its own.
#
# HOST_PREP_STRICT decides what host *drift* means — a swap file somebody else
# sized, a signature that is not swap, an /etc/fstab that was already broken, a
# disk too full, a kernel that will not take the file that is there. On demand
# (`true`) each of those is a hard failure, because fixing the host is the whole
# point of the run. During a release (`false`) each is a warning recorded as
# `skipped_reason`: the swap file and /etc/fstab are left untouched, vm.swappiness
# is still applied, and the release goes on. A release must never be stopped by
# the state of the host.
#
# Drift is not the same as a fault. A missing tool, a failing mkswap on a file
# this run just built, or an /etc/fstab that only our own line broke are bugs in
# this phase or in the host's basics, and they fail in either mode.
