# X post cards

A message containing an `https://x.com/<handle>/status/<id>` URL (or its
`twitter.com`, `www.`/`mobile.`, `/statuses/`, `/i/status/`, and
`/i/web/status/` variants) renders a live post card beneath the message:
author avatar, display name and @handle, the post text with URLs, mentions,
and hashtags linked, attached photos or a video poster, a quoted post when
present, the post time, reply/repost/like counts, and a "View on X" link.
The stored message body is never changed; references live in the
`twitter_post_references` join table and are re-synced when a message is
created or its Markdown source is edited.

## Where the data comes from

Cards resolve through the fxtwitter JSON API,
`GET https://api.fxtwitter.com/<handle>/status/<id>`, which needs no
credentials. Fetching happens in `Twitter::FetchPostJob`, never inline in
a request: on first reference, and once more when a new reference arrives
for a post whose recorded fetch error is older than 10 minutes. A post is
otherwise fetched once and never refreshed. The job is idempotent, safe
to enqueue concurrently, and records failures as `fetch_error` instead of
retrying forever.

The fetch client talks only to the fixed host `api.fxtwitter.com` — the
request path is built from the numeric post id and the validated handle,
never from a user-controlled host — with 5 s open / 10 s read timeouts, a
2 MB body cap, and a `Smartfire-X-Post-Cards` user agent. Only
`https://pbs.twimg.com/…` and `https://video.twimg.com/…` URLs are kept
for avatars, media, and thumbnails; anything else is dropped and the card
renders without that media. Everything from the API is treated as
untrusted text: names and post text are stripped of tags and escaped on
render, and the response body is never logged.

After a fetch, the card partial is broadcast via Turbo Stream replace to
each room (or thread) with a referencing message, over the existing
membership-gated message stream, so cards fill in live.

Rendering a card that never fetched re-enqueues its fetch, so a lost job
cannot leave "Loading post…" stuck forever; the fetch-request claim still
bounds this to one enqueue per post per 10-minute window.

## Limits and fallbacks

- At most 4 post links per message render cards, in order of appearance;
  repeats of one post render a single card.
- Before the fetch completes the card shows a compact "Loading post…"
  state. After a failure it shows a compact fallback with the @handle
  taken from the URL, "Couldn't load this post", and the "View on X" link.
- Long text clamps to 12 lines behind a "Show more" toggle. Videos and
  gifs show their poster with a play badge and link to the post; no player
  is embedded.
- Messages composed before this shipped keep rendering their stored
  OpenGraph embeds for non-post links. For post links, the old box keeps
  rendering until a `Twitter::Post` row exists for that post id — rows are
  created when a message is created or edited, or by the backfill below —
  and then the new card replaces it.

## Backfilling legacy messages

References only form when a message is created or edited, so untouched
legacy messages keep their old OpenGraph boxes until their references
are synced. The `BackfillTwitterPostReferences` data migration syncs
references for every message whose Markdown source or rendered rich-text
body contains a post URL; it runs with the normal `bin/rails db:migrate` on
deploy and is idempotent. The migration only creates references and
never enqueues fetch jobs, because migrations run before Redis is
reachable (the app migrates while `redis-server` is still starting, and
the release rehearsal runs with no network); each backfilled card
enqueues its own fetch the first time it renders. Outside a deploy,
`bin/rails twitter:backfill_references` runs the same sync ad hoc, does
enqueue fetches, and prints how many messages it synced.

The equivalent Rust operator command is:

```sh
campfire twitter-backfill-references /path/to/storage/db/production.sqlite3
```

It walks messages in batches of 1,000, selecting by Markdown source or
rendered Action Text HTML, and syncs references idempotently. It prints the same `Backfilled N messages` summary (singular for one). Fetch
jobs are saved durably with each message's reference changes for the
normal job runner to process; the command starts neither the server nor
network fetches. It requires an existing database with the current schema
and does not create or migrate a database.
