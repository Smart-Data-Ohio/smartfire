# Google Calendar publishing

Members can connect their Google account from their profile. Once connected,
every [native event](events.md) they are **going** or **maybe** to appears
on their primary Google Calendar as a private copy. Publishing is one way,
Smartfire to Google: edits made in Google are never read back, and the app
never reads the calendar, free/busy data, or attendees.

A later time change (or title/description edit) updates that same calendar
entry; declining, cancelling, or leaving the room removes it. The event page
shows "Added to your Google Calendar" while a copy exists for the viewer.

## Setup (Google Cloud Console)

For a deployment using sign-in and Drive too, follow the combined
[Google Workspace setup checklist](google-workspace-setup.md), including
publishing status and Workspace administrator approval.

1. Create (or reuse) a project and configure an **OAuth client** of type
   **Web application**.
2. Add an authorized redirect URI: `<app root URL>/google/callback`
   (for example `https://smartfire.example.com/google/callback`).
3. No extra APIs to enable beyond Google Calendar; the app requests
   `openid email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`.
   The `openid email` part is only used to read the account email from
   the `id_token` returned by the token endpoint (issuer, audience, and
   expiry are verified); the app makes no extra API call to learn it.
   Members who opt into [Drive link previews](google-drive.md) grant the
   additional `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly`
   scope through the same connect flow.
4. Set the client credentials on the app host:
   `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
5. Set `APP_URL` to the public application origin, for example
   `https://smartfire.example.com`. Background jobs use it to generate
   complete event and meeting-room links inside Google Calendar entries.
   It must contain a scheme and host, with an optional port, and no path.

These credentials can also support [Google sign-in](google-sign-in.md).
Sign-in uses its own `/session/google/callback` redirect and identity-only
permissions; signing in does not opt a member into Calendar publishing.

When either variable is missing, the profile shows "Google Calendar is not
configured for this workspace" and the connect routes answer 404.

## What is published and when

Connecting is the explicit opt-in: nothing is published for members who
have not connected. Each published entry carries the event title, the
description plus a "From Smartfire" link back to the event, the start/end
in the event's time zone (events without an end default to one hour), and
Google's default reminders. No Google attendees are added.

Publishing is reconciled by `Calendar::SyncEntryJob`, which recomputes the
desired state from the database on every run: an entry exists exactly when
the member is connected, is going or maybe, the event is not cancelled,
and the member is still in the room. Each occurrence of a recurring event
is its own calendar entry. The job is enqueued when an RSVP is
created or changes, when an event's time, title, or description changes,
when an event is cancelled, when an account is connected (all upcoming
going/maybe RSVPs), and when a membership ends.

This job opts out of retries, so failures are not retried on a timer:
a failure is recorded on the entry and the next change retries. The Google event id is deterministic per event and member
(`campfire` plus base32hex of the packed ids), and the local row is
reserved before the first request, so a retried insert reuses the same id
and concurrent first runs converge through the insert-conflict path
instead of creating duplicates. If Google reports the account's grant
revoked (`invalid_grant`), the account is marked disconnected, the local
entry being synced is destroyed immediately (its remote copy is
unreachable), and the profile offers a reconnect instead of publishing.

## Disconnecting

**Disconnect** on the profile removes the connection and every calendar
entry the app created for that member, best effort: entries Google refuses
to remove are logged and forgotten. Deleting a room destroys its local
entry rows; copies already in Google Calendar are left for the member to
remove.

Deactivating a member removes their room memberships, marks their Google
account disconnected ("Account deactivated") so no further syncs run for
it, and enqueues one cleanup sync per calendar entry; the reconciler sees
no membership and drops the local rows. Copies already in Google Calendar
are left for the member to remove, as with room deletion.

## Token storage

Refresh and access tokens are stored encrypted (`encrypts` on
`GoogleAccount`) with keys derived from `SECRET_KEY_BASE` (see
`config/initializers/active_record_encryption.rb`), so no separate secret
is needed. Rotating `SECRET_KEY_BASE` invalidates every stored Google
token: affected members must reconnect. Tokens are never logged or
rendered.
