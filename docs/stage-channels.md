# Stage channels

A stage channel is a room with a standing huddle where a few members speak
and everyone else listens. Hosts run the stage, speakers publish audio and
video, and listeners subscribe only. Each channel shows who is currently in
the call from the sidebar and the room header, and carries its own text chat
with durable history.

Stage channels reuse the voice channel's presence, sidebar, header, and text
chat wholesale; see [voice channels](voice-channels.md) for those. This
document covers only what is stage-specific: roles, enforcement, and hand
raising.

## Membership and roles

Stage channels are a room type (`Rooms::Stage`) with closed-room membership:
explicit members chosen by an administrator or the creator, managed through
the same members UI as closed rooms. Stage rooms keep their type: like voice
rooms, they never convert to or from another type. Mention notifications are
the default.

Every stage membership has a role (`listener`, `speaker`, or `host`) and an
optional raised-hand timestamp. Non-stage rooms leave both columns nil. The
room creator becomes the first host; members added later start as listeners.
Administrators and hosts can change any member's role from the stage panel,
including their own, except that the last host cannot be demoted.

Administrators manage through membership like everyone else: an administrator
who is not a member of the room gets the same 404 as any other non-member on
the role and hand endpoints.

## Joining and listening

The room header button reads **Join stage** and **Leave stage**. Joining uses
the same `huddle:join` event and huddle panel as every other room. A listener
joins subscribe-only: the microphone, camera, and screen-share controls stay
hidden and the panel shows a "You are listening" note instead. Hosts and
speakers get the full panel. The join control carries a server-rendered hint
from the viewer's stage role: a listener's hint skips the device prejoin
check and any microphone acquisition and connects directly, while the token
remains the authority for publishing after connect. Voice and DM joins pass
no hint and behave as before.

Stage rooms list in their own **Stage** section in the sidebar, immediately
after **Voice**, with a stage glyph and a separate **New stage channel** button.
They never create invitations, ringing, or missed-call items.

## Enforcement

Listener silence is enforced by the LiveKit token and by grant revocation,
not by hidden buttons.

- The join token carries `canPublish: false` and empty publish sources for
  listeners, and `canPublish: true` for hosts and speakers. Voice, DM, and
  channel tokens are unchanged.
- Each stage grant records the role it was issued for. The gateway's
  per-second authorization check revokes any grant whose issued role no
  longer matches the membership's current role.
- A role change that crosses the publish boundary (to or from listener)
  revokes the member's active grants in the same transaction as the role
  change, reusing the existing revocation path so the gateway removes the
  participant. The affected member's browser then rejoins with a fresh
  token for the new role; LiveKit permissions are never updated in
  place. A host↔speaker change keeps the same publish permission, so the
  grants keep their identity and just record the new role, and the member
  stays in the call with no rejoin.

To silence a speaker without removing them from the stage, a host
server-mutes them instead of demoting them: the mute revokes the speaker's
grants within the same transaction, and their browser rejoins subscribe-only
until a host unmutes them. Enforcement mirrors the role change — the muted
token carries `canPublish: false`, each grant records whether it was issued
muted, and the gateway's per-second check drops any grant that no longer
matches the membership — so a speaker whose grant somehow survived the mute
still loses publish on the next check. Hosts can also disconnect someone from
the call, which revokes their grants without sending a rejoin, so they stay
out until they join again. Neither action touches the membership; both end the
member's live stream, which cannot outlive the call. A host cannot moderate
their own session, and hosts cannot moderate administrators at all —
muting, unmuting, or disconnecting one answers 403. Administrators
moderate anyone, including each other, and a server-muted administrator
unmutes themselves from their own roster row.

## Hand raising

Listeners raise a hand from the stage panel; speakers and hosts have no hand
to raise. Hosts see raised hands first in the Listeners group, oldest first,
each with **Invite to speak** and **Lower hand**. Inviting promotes the
listener to speaker and clears the hand; lowering clears it without
promoting. Any role change clears the hand.

`POST /rooms/:room_id/stage/hand` raises the current member's hand and
`DELETE /rooms/:room_id/stage/hand` clears it. The DELETE endpoint also
accepts a `membership_id` parameter so a host or administrator can lower
another member's hand. `PATCH /rooms/:room_id/stage/roles/:membership_id`
changes a role; hosts and administrators only.

Raised hands render as a numbered queue — oldest first, `#1 in queue` onward —
and a newly raised hand notifies viewers who can act on it (hosts and
administrators) with an announcement and a short chime; other listeners see
the queue update without the fanfare. The queue numbers and the notification
are presentation over the same `hand_raised_at` ordering the roster already
used. Raising is idempotent — a double raise keeps the first timestamp and
queue place — and throttled to 10 raises per membership per minute; host
chimes and announcements debounce to one per membership per minute, so
hammering raise and lower notifies only once.

After a role change, a per-viewer roster is broadcast to every member's own
rooms stream — host action forms render only for hosts and administrators —
and a personalized panel is broadcast to the affected member's stream. A
rejoin event carrying the new role is appended to a persistent target inside
the member's huddle panel, which exists on every page unlike the stage
panel: the huddle panel leaves and rejoins the same room with a fresh token,
skipping the prejoin check. The persistent event is the only reconnect
trigger, so delayed delivery cannot reconnect twice. Consuming the event
also refreshes the member's stored publishing hint and the join control on
the current page, so a demoted speaker who retries a failed join — or leaves
and rejoins without navigating — connects as a listener instead of entering
microphone prejoin.

## Moderation

Removing a member from the stage uses the existing members UI, which already
ends their session and drops their sidebar row and header stack. An edit that
would remove the last host while members remain is rejected with 422 and an
inline error naming the host to replace first; emptying the room entirely
stays allowed. The members edit checks and revises inside one locked
transaction, and host demotions re-check after locking the room, so
concurrent removals cannot strand the room without a host. Deactivating the
sole host of a stage promotes a replacement in the same transaction that
deletes the memberships — an active administrator member when one remains,
otherwise the earliest-joined remaining member — so the stage stays
manageable; a stage left with no members at all is left empty. Role changes
are joined by two call-moderation tools: server-mute and disconnect, under
`POST /rooms/:room_id/call_moderation/:membership_id/mute`,
`DELETE /rooms/:room_id/call_moderation/:membership_id/mute`, and
`POST /rooms/:room_id/call_moderation/:membership_id/disconnect`, for hosts
and administrators only. There is no ban: removing a member from the stage
still uses the members UI.

## Deliberately not included

Recording and streaming to an external audience are not part of stage
channels. In-room streaming has shipped; see [streaming](streaming.md).
Per-speaker server mute has shipped as well (see above); what remains
deliberately absent is a ban.
