  # Quiet timeline notes (pin notes, group-DM membership notes): a message
  # with system_note still renders in the timeline and streams to it, but
  # skips every noisy side effect — Room/ChannelThread#receive (unread
  # marks and push), the unread badge broadcast, agent delivery, activity
  # inbox items, and the search index. Reuse this flag for new note types
  # instead of inventing another quiet path.
  #
  # Rendering is shared too: messages/_message branches on the flag into
  # messages/_system_note, one muted centered line (icon, actor name, note
  # text, timestamp) with role="note" and no avatar, toolbar, or menu
  # hooks. The flag rides in the fragment cache key, and notes are
  # immutable — every edit/delete path answers 403 for them.
