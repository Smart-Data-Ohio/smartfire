# Starting and ending broadcast the same four updates: the room header's
# Live badge on the room's messages stream, and the sidebar live dot, the
# event venue dot, plus a per-viewer stage panel on every member's own rooms
# stream. Automatic ends (demotion, removal, deactivation, grant revocation)
