class Github::PerformAgentActionJob < ApplicationJob
  # Runs an approved agent GitHub write action. Re-checks everything at
  # perform time — the approval is still approved, the agent is active and
  # still belongs to the room with external_action, the PR thread mapping
  # is still present, and the agent's linked account is still usable — and
  # performs the action with the agent's own token otherwise. Every outcome
  # is recorded as a github_action_completed ledger row; a failed re-check
  # or GitHub error makes no GitHub request beyond the failed call itself.
  # Never raises for GitHub or re-check failures, and never retries. Runs
  # at most once per approval: a queue retry or a duplicate enqueue finds
  # the earlier outcome row and stops. attempts: 1 opts out of the inherited
  # transient retries.
