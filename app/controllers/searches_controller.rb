    # The 100-row cap and the full rendering preloads are both deliberate. The
    # results are rendered through messages/_message, which reads boosts and
    # attachments, so the rows are loaded either way; preloading them only
    # changes when. Measured on a 150-message result set, a page of 100 holds
    # 1.24 MB of Ruby heap preloaded against 1.81 MB lazily, because preloading
    # instantiates one creator, room and blob per record rather than one per
    # row, and costs 12 queries against 370.
