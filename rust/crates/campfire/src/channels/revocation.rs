//! Revocation: `ActionCable.server.remote_connections.where(current_user: user).disconnect(reconnect:)`
//! (reference/app/models/user.rb `close_remote_connections`).
//!
//! The models emit it as `campfire_db::Event::DisconnectUser`:
//! - membership destroyed (`after_destroy_commit { user.reset_remote_connections }`, which covers
//!   `revoke_from`, `revise` and room destroy) and sign-out: `reconnect: true`. The client
//!   reconnects and replays its subscriptions, and the channels turn away the rooms it lost.
//! - `User#deactivate` and `User::Bannable#ban`: `reconnect: false`, once their transaction has
//!   committed and the sessions are gone, so a reconnect is refused. (Rails sends it inside the
//!   transaction; a connection authenticating just then could miss it and stay open. The cable
//!   connection also re-checks its session once it's listening for this.)
//!
//! Each connection of the user gets `{"type":"disconnect","reason":"remote","reconnect":..}` and
//! is closed; closing unsubscribes every channel (so `PresenceChannel#absent` runs).
