//! Ports of `reference/app/helpers` and the Rails built-in helpers Campfire's views use.
//!
//! Helpers return [`Html`] (askama's `Safe<String>`, the SafeBuffer equivalent), which templates
//! print unescaped; everything else is escaped by [`ErbEscaper`] exactly like ERB. Block helpers
//! (`link_to ... do`) live in [`filters`] and are used as askama filter blocks.
//!
//! Templates reach these as `h::name(...)` after `use crate::helpers as h;` in the view module.
